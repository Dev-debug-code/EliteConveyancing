<h1>Mortgage Report</h1>

<p><strong>Prepared for:</strong><br>
Property: 6 High Street<br>
Coton<br>

Date: 12 June 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Name of Lender :</strong> [LENDER]</p>
<p><strong>Initial Amount :</strong> [INITIAL_AMOUNT]</p>
<p><strong>Deductions from the Mortgage Advance :</strong><br>
[COST_ONCE]</p>
<p><strong>Net Mortgage Advance :</strong> [NET_ADVANCE]</p>
<p><strong>Term :</strong> [TERM]</p>

<p>We have now received a copy of your Mortgage Offer from your lender. You should
also have received a separate copy from the lender directly which may contain a
form for you to accept the Mortgage Offer. If you are in any doubt as to whether the
offer needs to be accepted you should check this with your lender.</p>

<p>This Mortgage Report does not contain any financial advice; please obtain that from
your lender, mortgage broker or an independent financial adviser. Accordingly we
have not reported to you on the financial elements of your mortgage such as interest
rates, repayments or the mortgage term. If you are in any doubt about these elements
you should speak to your lender or broker.</p>

<p>This report does, however, contain important legal advice to ensure that your legal
interests are adequately protected. Please read both the report and your Mortgage
Offer carefully and let us know if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>Expiry Date&nbsp;&amp; Reflection Period</h2>

<p>Your Mortgage Offer is valid until [EXPIRY_DATE].</p>

<p>You have the benefit of a seven-day reflection period from the date the offer was
issued. If you instruct us to draw down mortgage funds within that seven-day period
you will be waiving your right to reflect.</p>

<h2>Early Repayment Charge</h2>

<p>We draw your attention to Section [EARLY_REPAYMENT_SECTION] of your Mortgage
Offer, which contains details of Early Repayment Charges. These fees can run to
many thousands of pounds should you settle the mortgage before the end of your
benefit period, so please familiarise yourself thoroughly with this section.</p>

<h2>Mortgage Conditions</h2>

<p>The "Conditions" section of your Mortgage Offer sets out the terms on which the
mortgage has been offered. These are legally binding obligations and must therefore
be read carefully.</p>

<p>We particularly draw your attention to the following conditions:</p>

<p>[SPECIAL_CONDITIONS]</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is a condition of your mortgage that you have buildings insurance in place that
covers the property for at least its rebuild value. If this is not being arranged by your
lender or a management company you must arrange cover yourself from exchange of
contracts, as this is when the risk passes to you.</p>

<p>We also recommend that you consider Life Assurance, Critical Illness Insurance and
Income Protection Insurance to protect your loved ones and ensure that you can
continue to meet your mortgage payments if you become unable to work through
illness.</p>

<h2>Mortgage Deed</h2>

<p>The Mortgage Deed is a legally binding document that gives the lender the right to
secure a charge against the property. The property may be repossessed if you fail to
meet mortgage repayments.</p>

<p>Your Mortgage Deed must be signed by you and witnessed by an independent adult.
Full instructions are in the covering letter to this report.</p>

<p>If an occupier will reside in the property but will not be a joint owner, they must sign
either the Occupier section of the Mortgage Deed (if applicable) or a separate
Occupier's Waiver form.</p>

<p>Please return the executed Mortgage Deed (and any Occupier's Waiver, if
applicable) to us in hard copy.</p>

<h2>Mortgage Valuation Report</h2>

<p>If your Mortgage Offer contains a Valuation Report you should not rely on it as a
survey of the structural adequacy of the property. It is for lender use only and merely
gives an indication of value.</p>

<p>We recommend instructing an independent Building Survey by a RICS-accredited
surveyor so that any structural or condition-related issues are identified.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this important report. If you have any questions
or concerns, please raise them with us before exchange of contracts, at which point
your purchase becomes legally binding.</p>

<h2>Limitations of this Report</h2>

<p>This report does not constitute financial advice and must not be relied upon as such.
It is for use only by the parties for whom it was prepared. It relates solely to the
specific property referred to and must not be relied upon in respect of any other
property.</p>
