If you (or any one of you) have another mortgage with TSB Bank plc any security for that mortgage may also cover this mortgage loan. The terms and conditions for the other mortgage will state whether this applies.

## 4. Interest rate and other costs

The annual percentage rate of charge (APRC) is the total cost of the loan expressed as an annual percentage. The APRC is provided to help you to compare different offers.

The APRC applicable to your loan is 7.4%.

This assumes the interest rates are as follows for the full term of the mortgage.

It comprises:

Interest rate

A fixed rate of 4.69% that will apply from completion until 30/09/2029.

Followed by a variable rate which is TSB Homeowner Variable Rate, currently 8.74% , for the remaining term.

Costs to be paid on a one-off basis

- · £995.00 - Product fee. This is only refundable before the mortgage starts and is payable to Lender on submission of your application. This fee has been added to the loan.

Costs to be paid regularly

- · None

This APRC is calculated using assumptions regarding the interest rate.

Because part of your loan is a variable interest rate loan, the actual APRC could be different from this APRC if the interest rate for your loan changes. For example, if the interest rate rose to 9.24%, the APRC could increase to 9.70%.

The following costs are not known to the lender and are therefore not included in the APRC:

- · A fee may be payable to Premier Plus Limited on cancellation.
- · You may need to pay a fee to register the mortgage. The conveyancer will be able to confirm whether this is payable and the amount.
- · You will need to pay for buildings insurance.

Please make sure that you are aware of all other taxes and costs associated with your loan.

## 5. Frequency and number of payments

Repayment frequency: Monthly

Number of payments: 420

## 6. Amount of each instalment

One payment of £2141.64.

Then:

£1175.37 until 30/09/2029

£1774.75 until 31/07/2059

Your income may change. Please consider whether you will still be able to afford your monthly repayment instalments if your income falls.

The interest rate on part of this loan can change. This means the amount of your instalments could increase or decrease. For example, if the interest rate rose to 9.24% your payments could increase to £1935.90.

## 7. Additional obligations

The borrower must comply with the following obligations in order to benefit from the lending conditions described in this document.

You must make sure there is suitable buildings insurance in place as long as you have this mortgage. However, you are not obliged to buy this insurance from TSB Bank plc.

Additional features:

## 9. Flexible features

## Taking your product rate to a new mortgage

In the future, you can apply for a new loan on another property. If TSB Bank plc agrees to the new loan you can take the following product(s) and any early repayment charge with you for the remainder of the product rate period(s). New loan applications are assessed in line with the lending policy at that time which may, for example, affect the repayment method, loan or term. The new loan will be subject to the terms and conditions in force when you make your application.

## 49GU

Once you are paying interest at a lender variable rate or follow-on tracker rate, this rate cannot be taken to a new loan. If your application is made during an early repayment charge period, and the new loan is for a smaller amount than you owe, you may have to pay part of the charge. If the new loan is for a greater amount than you owe, you will need a new product for the extra amount you borrow.

## Underpayments

You may miss or reduce your monthly payments provided that you have previously made extra payments (overpayments). The total amount of underpayment(s) must not be more than the previous overpayments. Whenever we recalculate your monthly mortgage payment, we use any overpayments you have made to reduce what you owe; once we have done this, you will need to start building up new overpayments before you will be able to underpay again.

## Overpayments

You are able to make overpayments to this mortgage at any time subject to any early repayment charges detailed in the early repayment section above.

Sometimes you may be offered the opportunity to make lump sum or regular overpayments without having to pay an early repayment charge. Details of any current offers, which can change from time to time, can be found in the 'Information about your mortgage' booklet issued with mortgage offers.

## Payment holidays

Payment holidays may be available but are subject to rules that may be changed from time to time. If you apply, checks that you meet the rules in force at the time will be made. Payment holidays are not guaranteed. The current rules can be found in the 'Information about your mortgage' booklet which is issued with mortgage offers but you should ask for details for the latest rules when you make your request.

## Incentives

TSB Bank plc will not charge you for a valuation of the property, but will arrange for a valuer to make an assessment.

## Mortgage product:

- 49GU - This product is portable to another property, subject to any restrictions in your mortgage offer.
- 49GU - This product allows overpayments, subject to any early repayment charges.
- 49GU - This product allows payment holidays, subject to meeting the rules in place when you apply.

## 12. Non-compliance with the commitments linked to the loan: consequences for the borrower

Things you have to do:

- · TSB Bank plc lend you money on the basis that you pay what you should and repay everything you owe when you should, and do the other things you agree to under the agreement.
- · That includes using your property as your main residence (unless agreed otherwise) and keeping it in good repair and getting permission before you do certain things, for example letting your property, altering or adding to it or changing its use.
- · Make sure your property is insured and (where you arrange the insurance yourself) pay the property insurance premiums on time.

If you do not do what you should when you should you will be breaking the agreement. This means TSB Bank plc may take legal or other action and you will have to pay the costs of that. You could lose your property.

This is not an exhaustive list and you must read your Mortgage Conditions. If there is anything you are unsure about you should seek independent legal advice.

Should you encounter difficulties in making your monthly payments, please contact TSB Bank plc straight away to explore possible solutions.

As a last resort, your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up with payments.

## 13. Additional information

Any agreement will be governed by the laws and regulations of the country in which your property is situated. The laws and regulations of that country will also be taken as a basis for the establishment of relations with you before any agreement is entered into.

TSB Bank plc will give you a draft credit agreement if they make you a mortgage offer. The agreement for your mortgage loan is made up of Mortgage Conditions, offer letter, mortgage deed and any other agreement you make with TSB Bank plc to do with your mortgage loan.

## 14. Supervisor

## Supplementary Information

## Roll number: M543118052

This document should be read in conjunction with your Mortgage Illustration.

## The value of your property

The minimum property value shown in 'Main features of the loan' is the lowest the property value can be to proceed on the terms set out in this illustration. If the property value falls to an amount lower than this, please contact your intermediary.

Changes to the purchase price could also alter the terms set out in this illustration. If the purchase price changes, please contact your intermediary.

## Your loan amount and mortgage term

The illustration is based on a loan amount of £243,245.00, which includes £995.00 of fees that will be added to the loan over a term of 35 years. The term start date is the 1st of the month following the mortgage start date. For example, if someone takes a 10 year mortgage that starts on 15th June 2017, the mortgage term will start on the 1st July 2017, and end in June 2027.

Variable interest rates can change. Your illustration gives examples of how much more you could pay if rates increase. Mortgages usually take many years to repay and it is not possible to predict how much they may change over the life of your mortgage. The examples are based on the highest borrowing rate over the last 20 years. Interest rates could increase by more than this.

## Your first monthly payment

Your first monthly payment includes interest from the day the loan money is sent to your conveyancer, plus your first monthly mortgage payment. The 'Amount of each instalment' section of the mortgage illustration sets out your first payment assuming your mortgage starts on the 1st of the following month. Your first monthly payment will be different as it will depend on when your loan starts.

Your first payment is collected the month after your mortgage starts. For example, if your loan is released in June, your first payment will be collected in July.

Your first payment is collected on the day you choose unless we haven't been able to give you enough notice to collect it. We write to you when your mortgage starts to tell you when we will collect your first and subsequent payments. For more information, including an example of how to calculate your first payment, please refer to the 'Information about your mortgage' booklet which is issued with mortgage offers.

## If you don't keep up your repayments

- · Taking out this loan means you agree to pay your monthly payments on time and repay everything you owe by the end of the mortgage term. Failure to do so will increase the cost of the loan.
- · Your property may be repossessed if you do not keep up your mortgage payments.

## Changing your mind

You will have at least 10 days from the date of any offer letter to consider and reflect on the terms and conditions of the loan. If you wish to proceed before the 10 days expire you may, any offer letter will tell you how you can do this.
